quantitative measures of roster change from year to year. Specifically,


1. The % of players listed on the roster that are also listed on the roster the following year.

2. The % of players who started at least 9 games in one year that start at least 9 games the following

year.

3. The % of total games in common with a previous season. (e.g., If Player A participated in 10

games in 1989 and 6 games in 1990, there would be 6 games in common in 1990. If Player B

participated in 5 games in 1989 and 16 in 1990, there would be 5 games in common).

4. The % of total games started in common with a previous season (Basically the same deal as #3,

except with games started instead of games played).
